      <p class="smallbottom">Welcome to the official website of <span class="strongtext">Continuity Studios Ltd</span> &mdash; interactive systems development company based in Glasgow, UK.</p>
      <p class="largebottom"><a class="clink" href="/contacts.html">Contact us</a>. General info desk: <a class="wh" href="mailto:info@continuitystudios.co.uk">info@continuitystudios.co.uk</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-8 align-justify additional-padding">
      <p>We design, develop and maintain interactive systems spanning a <span class="strongishtext">multidisciplinary expertise area</span>, covering fields from artistic expression in interactive computer media to computer science and software engineering. We also provide business consultation from the perspective of software and general systems and provide <span class="strongishtext">business analyst services</span>.</p>
      <p>In particular, we are a software development company that currently has a degree of focus on <span class="strongishtext">video games</span> (this includes the domain of interactive art systems); but we also do <span class="strongishtext">IT contracting, systems development and maintenance</span> and we may be able to help with general business analysis.<!-- We see a continuous domain between particular interactive art systems on the one hand and abstract business processes that improve upon interactivity and mediation between essential parts of a business.--></p>
      <p>Continuity Studios is a newly estabilshed startup founded by professionals with a history of collaboration; we have banded together to focus our combined experience to do in-house software development while continuing to offer our bespoke IT contracting, freelancing and analyst services to our clients. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any enquiry type or for more details as we expand our website in the weeks to come.</p>
      <p>
      Our services include:
      <ul>
      <li>&rarr; <strong>company vision conceptualization and business strategy development</strong>:<br />
      we provide intense consultation in the very initial phases of a business or product development from the perspective of software systems analysis (general IT systems as well as business-specific systems conceptualization and later design)</li>
      <li>&rarr; <strong>software consulting and direct involvement in business plan development</strong>:<br />
      we strongly believe that in most cases where software/computer systems play a non-trivial role in a business it is crucial to have the perspective of software systems be directly incorporated into the process of business plan development through its multiple iterations</li>
      <li>&rarr; <strong>business and general systems analyst services</strong>:<br />
      we help to deploy more rigorous systems analysis on existing business strategies and processes; modeling and conceptualization of these processes from the perspective of general systems usually brings a fresh perspective and insights</li>
      <li>&rarr; <strong>analysis and development of communication processes</strong>:<br />
      we conceptualize and improve upon bridges between business strategy development and software &amp; general IT systems. Where possible, we help to develop standardized processes for communication and improved interaction between these often conceptually decoupled perspectives. We believe that mediation and its systematization can greatly increase the overall performance of any given business and that there usually are systematic approaches for achieving and quantifying the success of such projects</li>
      <li>&rarr; <strong>business-specific software systems design and implementation</strong>:<br />
      we can help with analyzing and understanding the market of current software solutions for a given business case; but we also do on-demand specific business systems design and software development; we are usually interested in at the very least being involved in, or taking upon ourselves the project of implementing business-specific software solutions, i.e. we like to partake in the actual implementation processes of such software systems. We hope to be able to showcase a portfolio of past and current projects of this kind soon &mdash; but contact us if you want to hear about some of them live</li>
      <li>&rarr; <strong>general software development</strong>:<br />
      we do backend and frontend web development; we are also interested in projects where deeper computer science knowledge is required. Currently we are doing software consultation, design and development related to computer vision and machine learning in the aviation field of industry.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <!--<p>For us, "interactivity" can mean the peculiar type of an art or video game system where there is a two-way relationship between the object and the subject, with both blending into a wholly interactive medium; but we see a continuity from this kind of structure into the problem of communication between different parts of a business. Being a software company first and foremost, we think that software analysts can help to bridge certain parts and improve upon the communication processes of a business.</p>-->

      <p>We are currently busy performing some mostly web backend development tasks for our clients.</p>
      <p>We are also preparing for our next iteration of in-house software which is to be a sound-focused video game and interactive art platform. We are going to be on-boarding new people for this project soon. <a class="clink" href="/contacts.html">Get in touch!</a></p>
